    <h5> First and foremost, I’m a huge football fan, 
        and my heart belongs to FC Barcelona. There’s 
        something special about their style of play—the 
        fast-paced, creative, and technical approach that 
        defines them. I’ve always admired the way Barcelona 
        builds their attacks, focusing on skill and vision, 
        and it’s a club that I feel embodies the spirit of 
        the game in the most beautiful way.  <br> <br> 

        
    <h1> Skills </h1>

       <h5> When I’m not out on the pitch,
         you can probably find me immersed in a good video game. 
         I’m a big fan of gaming and love exploring new worlds, 
         whether it’s a fantasy universe, a futuristic battlefield,
         or a sports simulation. Video games offer an amazing 
         escape, but also a chance to connect with friends and 
        other gamers around the world. I enjoy the strategy, 
        creativity, and skill that come with gaming, and I’m always 
        up for a challenge—whether it’s leveling up in an RPG, 
        conquering a multiplayer battle, or exploring the latest 
        game innovations. </h5> <br> <br>                                    ,

      <h5>  On top of my love for football and gaming, I take my 
        academics seriously. I’ve worked hard to maintain a 
        \solid background in school and strive to balance my 
        \passions with my education. I’m someone who values 
        learning and personal growth, and I’m proud of the effort
         I’ve put into my studies. I believe that a good education 
         is the foundation for achieving whatever I set my mind to,
          and it’s something I’m continuously working on improving.</h5>

          One time I had a football match against Atalanta and
          scored a free-kick and after I celebrated with the team.
